# GraphQL Migration Demo

## Prerequisites

- Node v16+
- yarn
- Docker

## Getting Started

There are 2 project folders in this repo under 'apps':

- server: Express.js API
- client: Next.js website

Before continuing, run `npm install` in both directories:

```bash
npm install
```

Once complete, you'll need to run the docker container and initialize the database.

### Docker Setup

To setup the PostgresQL image:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

To teardown the database:

```bash
docker compose down
```

To start and restart the docker image:

```bash
docker compose start

docker compose stop
```

### Initialize the Database

The following command will initialize the database, create the new tables, and seed the data. When asked for a name call it anything you'd like for instance, "init seed"

```bash
npm run prisma:migrate
```

### Run the server

```bash
cd server
yarn dev
```

### Run the client

```bash
cd client
yarn dev
```
