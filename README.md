# GraphQL Migration Demo

## Prerequisites

- Node v16+
- yarn
- Docker

## Getting Started

There are 2 project folders in this repo:

- server: Express.js API
- client: Next.js website

Before continuing, run `yarn` in both directories:

```bash
cd server && yarn && cd ../client && yarn && cd ..
```

Once complete, you'll need to run the docker container and initialize the database.

### Docker Setup

To setup the PostgresQL image:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

To teardown the database:

```bash
docker compose down
```

To start and restart the docker image:

```bash
docker compose start

docker compose stop
```

### Initialize the Database

The following command will initialize the database, create the new tables, and seed the data.

```bash
cd server
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

### Run the server

```bash
cd server
yarn dev
```

### Run the client

```bash
cd client
yarn dev
```
