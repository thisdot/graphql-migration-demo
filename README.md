# GraphQL Migration Demo

## Prerequisites

- Node v16+
- npm v7+

## Getting Started

There are 2 project folders in this repo under 'apps':

- server: Express.js API
- client: Next.js website

Before continuing, run `npm install` in both directories:

```bash
npm install
```

### Initialize the Database

The following command will initialize the database, create the new tables, and seed the data. When asked for a name call it anything you'd like for instance, "init seed"

```bash
npm run prisma:reset
```

### Copy `/apps/client/.env.sample` -> `/apps/client/.env`

### Run the server

```bash
npm run dev:server
```

### Run the client

```bash
npm run dev:client
```

### Run both for easy development

```bash
npm run dev
```
